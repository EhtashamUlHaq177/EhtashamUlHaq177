## 🛤️ My Developer Journey

### 🟢 Beginner Level Projects (Vanilla JS)
These projects mark the beginning of my web development path, focusing on core JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and UI logic.

- 🎯 **[Calculator](#)** — Simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations  
- 🎯 **[Image Slider](#)** — Auto/manual slider using DOM and timers  
- 🎯 **[To-Do List](#)** — Add/remove tasks with basic UI interactions  

### 🟡 Intermediate Projects
These were focused on building structured UI and better code separation, taking on slightly complex challenges.

- 🎵 **[Spotify Clone](#)** — Frontend clone of Spotify layout with image assets and folder structuring  
- 🎮 **[Connect 4 Game](#)** — Built in React, applying logic and UI interactivity in a real game  

### 🔵 Real-World Projects
These represent professional-level, production-ready work where I applied everything I've learned.

- 🛒 **[E-Commerce Website](#)** — Built with React; features modern layout and responsive design  
- 💼 **[Synctom Website](#)** — Live IT Company website using Tailwind, ShadCN, Axios, Sanity, Formspree *(ongoing updates)*
